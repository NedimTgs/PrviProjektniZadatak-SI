        Minerva McGonagall:
        Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts. She is a rather serious-looking woman, with jet-black hair scraped back into a tight bun on her head. She wears square glasses and an emerald-green cloak. Professor McGonagall is head of Gryffindor house and is the Transfiguration teacher. If you’ve read Chapter One of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s/Sorcerer’s Stone you will know that she can turn into a tabby cat!

      <p align="center">
        Albus Dumbledore:
        Headmaster of Hogwarts and Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards and Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. The finest wizard of his generation, Dumbledore is the only wizard that Voldemort is afraid of. Tall, thin and very old, he has blue eyes, a crooked nose and a long silver beard. He wears half-moon spectacles and a long purple cloak. He has a scar on his left knee which is a perfect map of the London Underground. As a schoolboy, he was in Gryffindor house.
      </p>
      <p align="center">
        Severus Snape:
        Potions master at Hogwarts, although apparently he knows an awful lots about the Dark Arts. He is tall and thin with sallow skin, greasy black hair and a hooked nose. He teaches his classes in the dungeons, where there are pickled animals floating in jars. Snape appears to hate Harry Potter, whilst Draco Malfoy is one of his favourite students. Though that isn’t surprising, as he is also head of Slytherin house.
